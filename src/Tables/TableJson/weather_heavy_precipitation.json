An even greater danger presented by a thunderstorm is the lightning that occurs during the storm. These electrical discharges, generated by the roiling clouds, can pose a hazard to creatures that do not have proper shelters, especially creatures clad in metal armor. Every 10 minutes during a thunderstorm, a bolt of lightning strikes an unsheltered creature at random (though this can strike wildlife as easily as PCs). A creature struck by this lightning must succeed a DC 18 Dex saving throw or take 10d8 points of electricity damage (a successful saving throw halves the damage). Creatures in metal armor take a Dex saving throw at disadvantage.\n\nThere is a 5% chance that a thunderstorm also generates a tornado, while thunderstorms with in temperatures higher than 30° C also have a 20% chance of being a precursor to a hurricane. There is a 20% chance that a thunderstorm of any strength in a desert also generates a haboob.",
